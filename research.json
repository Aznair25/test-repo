                "summary": "In recent years, large language models (e.g., Open AI's GPT-4, Meta's LLaMa,\nGoogle's PaLM) have become the dominant approach for building AI systems to\nanalyze and generate language online. However, the automated systems that\nincreasingly mediate our interactions online -- such as chatbots, content\nmoderation systems, and search engines -- are primarily designed for and work\nfar more effectively in English than in the world's other 7,000 languages.\nRecently, researchers and technology companies have attempted to extend the\ncapabilities of large language models into languages other than English by\nbuilding what are called multilingual language models.\n  In this paper, we explain how these multilingual language models work and\nexplore their capabilities and limits. Part I provides a simple technical\nexplanation of how large language models work, why there is a gap in available\ndata between English and other languages, and how multilingual language models\nattempt to bridge that gap. Part II accounts for the challenges of doing\ncontent analysis with large language models in general and multilingual\nlanguage models in particular. Part III offers recommendations for companies,\nresearchers, and policymakers to keep in mind when considering researching,\ndeveloping and deploying large and multilingual language models.",

These models have been shown\nto yield good performance, using in-context learning, even on unseen tasks and\nlanguages. They have also been exposed as commercial APIs as a form of\nlanguage-model-as-a-service, with great adoption. However, their performance on\nAfrican languages is largely unknown. We present a preliminary analysis of\ncommercial large language models on two tasks (machine translation and text\nclassification) across eight African languages, spanning different language\nfamilies and geographical areas. Our results suggest that commercial language\nmodels produce below-par performance on African languages. We also find that\nthey perform better on text classification than machine translation. In\ngeneral, our findings present a call-to-action to ensure African languages are\nwell represented in commercial large language models, given their growing\npopularity.",

                "summary": "For many low-resource languages, the only available language models are large\nmultilingual models trained on many languages simultaneously. However, using\nFLORES perplexity as a metric, we find that these models perform worse than\nbigrams for many languages (e.g. 24% of languages in XGLM 4.5B; 43% in BLOOM\n7.1B). To facilitate research that focuses on low-resource languages, we\npre-train and release Goldfish, a suite of monolingual autoregressive\nTransformer language models up to 125M parameters for 350 languages. The\nGoldfish reach lower FLORES perplexities than BLOOM, XGLM, and MaLA-500 on 98\nof 204 FLORES languages, despite each Goldfish model being over 10x smaller.\nHowever, the Goldfish significantly underperform larger multilingual models on\nreasoning benchmarks, suggesting that for low-resource languages,\nmultilinguality primarily improves general reasoning abilities rather than\nbasic text generation. We release models trained on 5MB (350 languages), 10MB\n(288 languages), 100MB (166 languages), and 1GB (83 languages) of text data\nwhere available. The Goldfish models are available as baselines, fine-tuning\nsources, or augmentations to existing models in low-resource NLP research, and\nthey are further useful for crosslinguistic studies requiring maximally\ncomparable models across languages.",
